# AirQualityDataServices
This repo contains both backend and frontend services for the NHBP air quality Anemowen Dashboard.  Project was initiated in the summer of 2020, most recent update **April  2021**.   
The project is deployed on GCP via Firebase hosting.  The functions folder contains two endpoints: **/purpleAirData/:stationList** which takes a comma separated list of Purple Air Staion ID's as a URL parameter.  The other endpoint: **/msuWeatherData/:stations** takes a comma separated list of weather station identifiers for the MSU Enviro Weather Service.  Both services return a JSON payload, formatted as GeoJSON with longitude and latitude coordinates (WGS84).   

NHBP Currently has five Purple Air sensors deployed, with several more going online soon.  Currently the wiget shows the NHBP IoT sensors, and the map shows NHBP sensors, additional Purple Air sensors, and stations from AirNow.gov.  Additional text air quality forecasting is planned to be added to the Dashboard in the summer of 2021.
